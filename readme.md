### Welcome to the ACM and WIC GitHub workshop!

Here are some things you should try.

1. Fork me!
2. Clone your fork by typing `git clone github.com/my_name/GitTutorial.git`
3. Make a text file in your new local repository.
4. `git commit` your new file, then `git push` it!

Congratulations! You know git!
